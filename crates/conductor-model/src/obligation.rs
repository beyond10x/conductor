//! The typed refusal of an unmet obligation, and the conversion seams owed between contexts.
//!
//! An obligation is a capability the synthesis plan owes the implementor — the contract is declared,
//! the behaviour is not. Until an implementation satisfies one, its stub returns [`UnmetObligation`]:
//! a value naming the plan entry, never a panic and never a guess, so a workspace built on stubs
//! compiles and reports its own gaps.

/// A capability the synthesis plan owes and nothing has satisfied yet.
///
/// The two fields spell the plan entry: look the pair up in `PLAN.md` for the contract being
/// refused. A satisfying implementation never constructs one.
